# Comments / Questions

# Should we keep the fastq.gz files because some samples only have FASTQ
# produced

# Should we keep the original BAM or the clean.dedup.recal version?

# Should we keep any VCF? If we keep the RAW one, we save a lot of processing
# time if we need to re-evaluate an old sample.
