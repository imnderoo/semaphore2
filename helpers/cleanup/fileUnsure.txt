Folders that should probably keep
=================================
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Interop
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Data/reports
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Data/Status_Files
	- These are raw folders containing  metrics and summary

/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Config
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Recipe
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>PeriodicSaveRates
	- These are raw folders containing configuration parameters for the
	  runs.

/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Data/RTALogs
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Logs
	- These are raw folders containing the log files produced by the
	  machine or RTA

/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Basecall_Stats_*/Demultiplex_Stats.htm
/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Basecall_Stats_*/BustardSummary.xml
	- These files contain summary QC metrics

Folders that we should probably delete
=======================================
/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Undetermined_indices
	- There are fastq.qz in there that takes up a lot of space... do we need to keep?

/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Data/Intensities
/data2/raw/runs/<RUN_ID>/Thumbnail_Images
/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Basecall_Stats_*/Matrix
/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Basecall_Stats_*/Phasing
/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Basecall_Stats_*/SignalMeans
/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Basecall_Stats_*/Temp
	- These are raw run folders containing image / signal intensities
	- Do we need to keep the raw images / signal intensities for audits? 
	- Is it sufficient to just keep the QC metrics?

/data2/analysis/<RUN_ID>/Temp
	- Seems to be empty directories
